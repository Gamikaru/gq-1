# üé® UX/UI Designer Guide

Welcome Designer! You make the app beautiful and easy to use. This guide is just for you!

## üìÅ Your Workspace
You work in the `/css` folder. Your files:
- `global.css` - Controls the ENTIRE app's look
- `home.css` - Styles for home page
- `explore.css` - Styles for explore page  
- `create.css` - Styles for create page
- `profile.css` - Styles for profile page

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Step 1: Explore the Current Design
1. Open the app in your browser
2. Right-click anywhere ‚Üí "Inspect"
3. Look at the Styles panel to see current CSS
4. Try changing values in the browser to test ideas!

### Step 2: Plan Your Design
Think about your client:
- What colors represent them?
- Formal or casual?
- Modern or traditional?
- Fun or serious?

### Step 3: Start with Colors
Open `global.css` and find this section:
```css
:root {
    --primary: #007AFF;        /* Change this to your main color */
    --background: #000000;     /* Change this to your background */
    --text-primary: #FFFFFF;   /* Change this to your text color */
    /* ... more colors ... */
}
```

## üí° Designer Tips & Tricks

### 1. Use the Browser Inspector!
- See what styles are applied
- Test changes live
- Find class names to style
- Check mobile view (device icon)

### 2. Work in Order
1. First: Update colors in `global.css`
2. Second: Update fonts and spacing
3. Third: Style individual pages
4. Last: Add animations and polish

### 3. Mobile First
Always check how it looks on phone:
- Make browser narrow
- Buttons big enough to tap?
- Text readable?
- Spacing good?

## üéØ Common Tasks

### Change a Button Color
```css
.btn-primary {
    background: #your-color-here;
}
```

### Make Something Bigger
```css
.header-title {
    font-size: 24px;  /* Increase number */
}
```

### Add Hover Effects
```css
.button:hover {
    background: darker-color;
    transform: scale(1.05);  /* Slightly bigger */
}
```

### Round Corners More
```css
.card {
    border-radius: 20px;  /* Increase for rounder */
}
```

## üîß Troubleshooting

### "My styles aren't working!"
1. Did you save? (Ctrl+S / Cmd+S)
2. Did you refresh? (F5)
3. Check spelling of class names
4. Try adding `!important` (temporary fix)
5. Check if another style is overriding

### "It looks weird on mobile!"
1. Use percentages instead of fixed pixels
2. Check your media queries
3. Make text at least 16px
4. Test buttons with your finger

### "I don't know what colors to use!"
1. Look up your client type + "brand colors"
2. Use coolors.co for palettes
3. Ask AI for suggestions
4. Keep it simple - 3-4 colors max

```css
margin: 10px;      /* Space outside */
